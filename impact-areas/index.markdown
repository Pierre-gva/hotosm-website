Solving global challenges requires an understanding of our physical environment that is grounded in direct knowledge and observations. Open mapping helps us build that understanding together, which enables humanitarian, development, and community organizations to take more informed and locally appropriate action. 
Impact Areas connect open mapping with real world applications through spatial data use in the humanitarian and development sectors. Each impact area at HOT provides a framework for technical and subject matter expertise for partnerships, grantmaking, and community support.

*Are you working with OSM in one of HOT’s impact areas? We’d love to hear from you on what data you are using, what analysis has worked, and other feedback at data@hotosm.org.*
