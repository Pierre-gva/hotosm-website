Everyone is probably well familiar with hot_techâ€™s, [right turn](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ATrtqB4FbUmZN3TB1dCRXEeJI9Uvg82UWII_jxIkTEw/edit?usp=sharing)  and  [TM Tomorrow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tTT4oKUN34FThzbNFZKfj0lhQOMRB4uTF1n2rO1iHrc/edit?usp=sharing) ambitions - our main goal being to work less controllingly and more collectively in how we build our tech. 

Our first step in putting these words into action is by building and investing in contributors, makers, tinkerers and users to support the maintenance, evolution and growth of humanitarian OSM tools, 

It is therefore with great excitement and pleasure that I have the opportunity to officially announce the first member of this tech_collective: [___Kathmandu Living Labs___](https://www.kathmandulivinglabs.org/) who will be taking on the maintenance of the HOT tasking manager for the next 6 months (and possibly beyond). 

Each month, KLL, hot_tech (and a future community product owner), will be sitting down to identify and triage the most pressing issues expressed by the Tasking Manager community. These issues will be available for viewing as a public project on our [TM github](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager).  KLL will then be applying their brilliant minds to tackling these issues to best serve the needs of Tasking Manager collective and the wider HOT and OSM communities. Monthly deployments will then be handled in collaboration with the hot_tech core team (shout out to DK and Yogesh for their often thankless behind the scenes efforts on this).

If you have issues, features or enhancements that are either new, or outstanding, I highly encourage you to start getting them shaed and consolidated in the [TM github repo](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager). Triage will be based on community resonance and response, so if there are others you know that share your issues, bringing others around these common issues will bring them up in the triage. 

I for one am very excited about step toward TM tomorrow and I encourage everyone to welcome KLL and and engage in the [#tasking-manager](https://hotosm.slack.com/archives/C319P09PB) channel or submit issues via the [TM github](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager)
