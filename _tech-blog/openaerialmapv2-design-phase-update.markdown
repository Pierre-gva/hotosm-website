We wanted to provide you with an update of the next phase of the OpenAerialMap Project. Hopefully you have already read the [Kick Off blog](https://www.hotosm.org/tech-blog/openaerialmap-v2-design-kicks-off/). You can see an overview of the different project phases and where we currently are!

I am sure you will be interested to know what has happened since mid-April. Well, the Kontur team has been pretty busy!

## Design phase

Following completion of the Discovery phase (you can read the full report summarizing research and discovery phase [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCXx6D8F6Xz4vLhamT794IE_Zegp3eaSG9kV_QT0KUk/edit)), the Kontur team went into the Designing phase, which included a number of workshop activities! We want to start by thanking everyone who participated in the workshop with ideas and suggestions!  17 participants from 13 community groups took part in 3 workshops at the end of April.  You can see the location of where people joined in the virtual workshops below - we were very pleased with the diversity of participants in the workshops!

For each workshop, the Kontur team took one user persona (Imagery contributor, Mapping project manager and GIS analyst), discussed each pain point with the participants and generated ideas, and also provided some examples of apps/programs where these ideas are already designed and solved users’ needs. Also, participants shared additional ideas and their own experiences of using OAM. You can read more about the personas and problem statements being discussed in [section 3 of the summary report.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MCXx6D8F6Xz4vLhamT794IE_Zegp3eaSG9kV_QT0KUk/edit?pli=1)

You can see the smiley and deep-into-ideas-generation faces of participants in the second workshop focusing on the GIS Analyst persona. Some of the pain points being covered were “not having enough filters” or “not being able to navigate easily through data”. Some of the ideas that the group came up with were about new filter types, improving communication between imagery users and contributors, and providing more documentation on how to work with OAM and how to use it.

This is just one example. If you are interested to see the list of ideas from all workshops you can check the ideas page in this spreadsheet [Ideas list ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1xGYqJNn2Mj2AFGMNExIfHFgxyOtBedmNPu7ZcyNJ0J0/edit?pli=1#gid=2125854031)and also materials on the [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOG8LMPk=/). 

## Prototyping and testing
During the month of May the Kontur team has been working on developing design prototypes using Figma. The HOT_tech team is currently reviewing the prototypes - you can see two examples below:
![Prototype1.png](https://cdn.hotosm.org/website/Prototype1.png)
![Prototype2.png](https://cdn.hotosm.org/website/Prototype2.png)

During the month of June the project will enter the Testing Phase with OAM users! Following that the Kontur team will analyze the feedback received from users before providing recommendations for features and improvements, and entering the last phase of the OAM Design Project.
