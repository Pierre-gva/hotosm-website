Summary Text: This month I have been feeling like the world has been spinning faster
  than ever. Does anyone else feel that? The days just don’t seem as long as they
  used to be? Do the image offsets seem to be more often and further than they have
  been in the past?

Happy Friday all, \
\
This month I have been feeling like the world has been spinning faster than ever. Does anyone else feel that? The days just don’t seem as long as they used to be? Do the image offsets seem to be more often and further than they have been in the past?

For the team this month, we have been reflecting a lot on the work we have been taking on the last couple of years and how we are going to build on that for the years ahead. We are taking time to think about who hot_tech is in the wider OSM ecosystem and how what we do can amplify the work of those who share HOT’s mission.

What does this all mean in practical terms? Well, in June, our team is getting together in-person in Kathmandu for the first time in…well…ever (for many of us), and we want to make the most of this time to decide as a team three key things: Why we do what we do, what the future looks like for us, and how we need to act to ensure that future we in vision.

While we don’t have all the answers we do know there are three things that are going to be at the top of our list to discuss for our future: mobile, AI, data accessibility, and locally led contributions. At the end of our time together, we aim to have clear product visions and strategies that we can share with everyone to show where we see our tech and our team heading for the next year or so. Then we will be looking forward to hearing what everyone thinks :)

Kindness,

P.S. Oh and project managers, did you see that RapID is now integrated into the Tasking Manager? Let us know what you think.

## # Project updates:

### ## Galaxy

The Galaxy team has been working solidly this month, on a final push for the completion of underpass, the stabilising of export tool and closing out our design project with Harvard Tech for Social Good. If you want the latest updates, connect to the [#osm-galaxy channel](https://hotosm.slack.com/archives/C02BHN4LE7K) in our slack and join the monthly working groups.

### ## Tasking Manager

The Kathmandu Living Labs team has been going from strength to strength, updating and releasing extra bug fixes for Tasking Manager (including the new RapID integration). We will be meeting with the KLL team in Kathmandu (IN PERSON!), so if you have requests, now’s the time to add them to the [github issues here and now >](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/issues)

### ## OAM

We are now wrapping up phase one of the design work with Kontour for the redux of OAM. Some super interesting insights coming out of this that we will be sharing soon, and I want to thank everyone who contributed to this process for their inputs. We really hope that what comes out will be a good exchange for what you put in.

### ## Export tool

We acknowledge that we’ve been having some issues with export tool this month and I apologise for the disruptions some of you may have been facing. Kshitij, our super engineer from Nepal has been working hard at correcting the issues and the rest of the team is now working toward replacing the data source with Underpass. Watch this space, I’ve seen a preview and I think you’re going to like what’s coming…
