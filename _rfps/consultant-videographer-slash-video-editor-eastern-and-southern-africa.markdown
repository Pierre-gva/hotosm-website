The purpose of the program is to support the design and implementation of innovative map data solutions and projects that have a significant positive impact on people's lives in the region.

The Open Mapping Grants program is currently supporting eight projects in five countries in the region. The projects consist of a wide and diverse application of open map data from advancing access to contraceptives to centering community voices in disaster preparedness and creating opportunities for youth engagement in social change initiatives.
