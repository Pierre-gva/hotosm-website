Amelia has worked in both humanitarian and development contexts across sub-saharan Africa and southeast Asia, with an interest in understanding behavior motivations within communities, and mobilizing grassroots action.

Amelia started her journey by mapping subterrain geologic features of California, then moved to seafloor mapping in Papua New Guinea. She found mapping communities in Nepal fit best with her interests, and continued to expand her work in Water, Sanitation and Hygiene, proposal development, and program management. Amelia has lived and worked in Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Nigeria, Nepal and Cambodia and speaks English (mostly), Nepali and Spanish, while dabbling in many other languages. She has a BS in Earth Science from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a MS in Civil Engineering from the University of Colorado, Boulder. If she's not jetting off to another country, you can find Amelia ripping down mountain bike trails, speeding through triathlons, or sewing up new clothes.
