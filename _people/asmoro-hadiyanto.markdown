Asmoro cumulated his regional experiences in Asia Pacific countries during his time with the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center (ADPC) as Manager, and with Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN) as the Secretary-General. As for his hands-on experiences with the community at the grass-root level, he cultivated it when he was mandated as the Executive Director for Disaster Management Center with assignments covering countries hit by social conflicts and natural disasters ranging from Iran, Syria, Turkey, to Nepal, Japan, and the Philippines.
