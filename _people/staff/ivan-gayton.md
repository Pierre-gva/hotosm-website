Ivan Buendía Gayton works at the nexus of humanitarianism, technology, and human rights. Prior to joining HOT in 2017, he worked for fifteen years with Médecins Sans Frontières in various capacities including Head of Mission, field logistician, Humanitarian Affairs Officer, and GIS and Technological Innovation Advisor, and served on the board of directors of MSF-Canada. He co-founded the Missing Maps project, worked on medical records for Ebola, and created the MapSwipe mobile mapping application. He is an advocate of Free Software, and considers it critical to racial justice and equity, particularly in the aid sector, and believes that "local people, local devices, and open knowledge" are key to effective humanitarian tech and inclusion. He works on local manufacturing of drones in low-income settings, and low-cost, high-precision surveying for community and smallholder land rights.
