Sanjana has a Master's degree from Banasthali University and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering from the College of Engineering Roorkee. She joined Ashoka Innovators for the Public's Youth Venture program in 2017, which supports more than 300+ young changemakers to embark on social entrepreneurship. After Ashoka, she worked with the Sarojini Damodaran Foundation, co-leading the educational program outreach, expansion, partnership management, and engagement. She worked with Quest Alliance to strengthen the organization's goal of building the capacity of educators and students in India by integrating technology, and entrepreneurship, and equipping them for employment before joining HOT as Partnership Manager for the Asia-Pacific Region.

As much as she enjoys working with youth, she understands systemic change and believes that networks can help people take collective action by taking a multi-stakeholder approach. She has spent the last few years focusing on program development through philanthropy, identifying system-changing solutions, building strategic government and non-profit partnerships, and investing resources and expertise to bring newer opportunities through collaboration.
