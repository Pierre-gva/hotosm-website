I joined the HOT tech team in February 2022 as Tech Collective Facilitator. Originally from Bulgaria, I am currently based in Bristol, UK. I am really passionate about the impact of open mapping and using technology as the enabler for people in supporting their communities.  In this role, I hope to be able to successfully build a dynamic collective of open tech contributors from around the world!

I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Economics and International Development from the University of Sussex and an MSc in Economics (Development) from the University of Bath, UK. I started my career working for the UK’s Economic and Social Science Research Council (ESRC), leading a portfolio of research programs in international development. I then transitioned into the world of open data and fell in love with it and especially the people and communities there!  Over the past five years,  I worked for the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) where I provided direct support to many developments and humanitarian organizations in publishing open data, managed various open tech products, and organized training and community workshops in Senegal, Nepal, and Tanzania.
