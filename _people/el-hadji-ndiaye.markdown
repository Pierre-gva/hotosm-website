Elhadji has come on board with a lot of experience. Before joining us, he had, among other responsibilities, managing the communication of the Agency of Energy Economy of Senegal (AEME) as Communication Director. He was then regional director at Havas, a multinational company that specialized in communication. He had the opportunity to work with the biggest brands in the world.

He has a good experience in engagement campaigns (online, offline, and event). His skills in graphic design and digital are very useful to give HOT more visibility. He also helps in developing the movement we want to create in the whole region and beyond.
