Mexico has committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. In preparation for the [Climate Action Plan](https://www.gob.mx/sedatu/documentos/estrategia-nacional-de-ordenamiento-territorial-de-la-sedatu-2020-2040), the aim is to build effective synergies between local and national stakeholders. This will help identify, analyze, evaluate, and prioritize city-level climate change mitigation and adaptation actions with active stakeholder engagement.

The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) will provide technical support to the municipality of Tulum, Quintana Roo. Data will be obtained to develop and strengthen municipal climate action plans, the planning capacities and technical capacities of municipal staff to better manage the pressures of urban growth, tourism, and disaster  risks. HOT will provide  replicable participatory mechanisms, based on local communities and OpenStreetMap communities.  This will aid  the continuous creation of data to capture changes and measure the real-time impact of environmental damage, as well as participating in the development of integrative methodologies.
