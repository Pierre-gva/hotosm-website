From 13 March 2023 to 20 June 2023, the Open Mapping Hub - Eastern and Southern Africa is running a mapping campaign aimed at increasing the visibility of women-focused points of interest (POIs) on OpenStreetMap (OSM).

This campaign mobilises the open mapping community to put amenities used by women and girls in communities across East and Southern Africa on the map (although everyone is welcome regardless of their location!)

This can include health facilities, schools, childcare, police stations and much more. A [full data model is available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aIaYkWQlxq-E6ofRrvYdXageqWJCkSMGSi2CicLU5wM/edit?usp=sharing)!

We hope that by putting these vital amenities on the map that we can improve access to services, visualise what is available and help people advocate for increased and improved services.
