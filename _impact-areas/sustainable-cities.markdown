summary: Service delivery and infrastructure in disadvantaged urban and rural areas,
  including transportation, water and sanitation, and energy.
block-1:
  intro: As populations continue to grow and more people move to urban areas, stress
    on resources increases. Open mapping platforms can allow for local governments
    and communities to collaborate for more efficient access to basic services. Better
    mapping can lead to informed planning and better and more equitable living conditions
    in communities and informal settlements.
