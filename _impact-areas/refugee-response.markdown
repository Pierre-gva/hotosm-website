summary: Coordinated service delivery for migrants and people displaced from home
  in transit, camp settings, and other informal contexts.
block-1:
  intro: Conflict, persecution, violence, and weather related events have caused a
    record 100 million people worldwide to be displaced (UNHCR May 2022). Challenging
    migration routes many times lead to under-resourced camps or undesirable conditions
    squatting  in urban or rural settings. Women and minors are often disproportionately
    affected. Limited resources for migrants, especially in host communities, require
    accurate geospatial data to ensure efficient support of those in need.
