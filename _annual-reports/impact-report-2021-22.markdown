The 2021-22 Impact Report is a virtual world tour of humanitarian open mapping projects around the globe. We spotlight projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Uganda and Nepal, and we’ll also make stops in more than 40 other countries where the open mapping movement is touching people’s lives. The Impact Report is an exploration of the intersection between technology and the global open mapping movement and the extraordinary impact it is having in global communities.
