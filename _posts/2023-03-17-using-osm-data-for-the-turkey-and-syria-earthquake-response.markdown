title: Using OSM Data in the Turkey and Syria Earthquake Response
date: 2023-03-17 01:57:00 Z
Summary Text: In the aftermath of the Syria-Turkey earthquake, OSM is allowing responders
  to quickly access up-to-date maps and geospatial data to aid in search and rescue
  efforts,  access and contextualize damage assessments, and plan relief and recovery
  efforts. Here are the data sets available for response organizations and examples
  of how they are being used.

After any disaster, good data is critical to inform life-saving and life-sustaining activities and, eventually, recovery programs. Since 2010's [devastating earthquake in Haiti](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/haiti_), Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) and the wider OpenStreetMap (OSM) community have provided spatial data to inform disaster response and recovery. OSM’s ability to quickly provide up-to-date maps and crowdsourced geospatial data, integration with other technologies, and accessibility make it an invaluable resource for disaster response efforts.

In the aftermath of the [Syria-Turkey earthquake of February 2023](https://reliefweb.int/disaster/eq-2023-000015-tur), OSM is again a valuable resource, allowing responders to quickly access up-to-date maps and geospatial data to aid in search and rescue efforts,  access and contextualize damage assessments, and plan relief and recovery efforts. 

## Applications of OSM data use in an earthquake disaster response include:

### Basemaps and Essential Infrastructure Reference Layers 

OSM data provides context for where major roads and populated areas are, as well as the location of aid distribution centers, pharmacies, medical facilities, and other vital resources. Basemaps and roads from OSM of the most common datasets included in early maps of an affected region, while specific infrastructure information is used to identify what type of services are likely to be impacted or still in service. 

**Download OSM Roads for [Turkey](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_tur_roads) and [Syria](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/hotosm_syr_roads).**

Examples of this data in maps, analysis, and planning:
* [Northwest Syria - Earthquake Exposed Communities & CCM Sites](https://www.impact-initiatives.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/REACH_SYR_Northwest_Syria_Earthquake_Exposed_Communities_Population_CCCM_09Feb2023.png) & [Item Unavailability](https://www.impact-initiatives.org/what-we-do/news/turkiye-and-syria-emergency-response-activated-following-two-powerful-earthquakes/) (REACH Initiative)
* [General Logistics Planning Map](https://reliefweb.int/map/syrian-arab-republic/syrian-arab-republic-turkiye-general-logistics-planning-map-07-february-2023) (Logistics Cluster)
* [Context Update Syria: Earthquake Edition](https://immap.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/iMMAP_February-Context-Update_Syria_Earthquake-Edition.pdf) (iMMAP & USAID)

**Use OSM basemaps in [QGIS](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/quick_map_services/) or [ESRI](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=fae788aa91e54244b161b59725dcbb2a) products).**

Examples of this data in maps, analysis, and planning:
* [Activation Map](https://reliefweb.int/map/turkiye/activation-797-call-919-earthquakes-turkey-idana-aoi-id-31-observed-pleides-1a-image-09-february-2023) (International Charter Space and Major Disasters)
* [Activation Map](https://emergency.copernicus.eu/mapping/sites/default/files/thumbnails/EMSR648-AEM-1676306112-r10-v2.jpg) (Copernicus)

More related maps and IM products can be found on [ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/updates?advanced-search=%28D51470%29_%28F12.F12570%29) or [iMMAP](https://immap.org/news/turkiye-syria-earthquake-flash-updates/)’s flash updates. 

OSM data can also be combined with other data sources, such as damage analyses, to create models and maps to help with recovery planning and decision-making. For example, The World Bank used OSM as an input for infrastructure modeling to give context to satellite-detected damage in Turkey in their report: [Global Rapid Post-Disaster Damage Estimation (GRADE), Türkiye Report.](https://reliefweb.int/report/turkiye/global-rapid-post-disaster-damage-estimation-grade-report-february-6-2023-kahramanmaras-earthquakes-turkiye-report) (Information on OSM and damage dataset examples and methodologies coming soon).

The availability of detailed, up-to-date map data is an important resource in all stages of the disaster recovery process, and OSM data will also be used for **long-term recovery efforts**, such as rebuilding infrastructure and housing and improving disaster preparedness. OSM data can be added to or accessed by anyone, making it a strong platform to connect local communities to all levels of response. 

For information on OSM data use or possible data collection collaborations, contact [partnerships@hotosm.org](mailto: partnerships@hotosm.org). 

It is important to remember that behind each data point, there is a tremendous human effort from volunteers and organizations. Every single addition of the 80,124 KM of road and 2,065,242 buildings mapped so far in this response has had human eyes creating, modifying, or validating it.
