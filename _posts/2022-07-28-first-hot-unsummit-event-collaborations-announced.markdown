Since we announced [our HOT unSummit approach for 2022](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/update-on-the-2022-and-2023-summits/), we have been busy developing collaborations with conference organizers across the world to bring the humanitarian open mapping focus and spirit of the HOT Summit to 1000s of new people in many new places.

Today, we are happy to announce our first confirmed unSummit programme collaborations, spanning twelve events across eleven countries!

We fully expect more event collaborations to be added to this list in the weeks to come, so watch this space for more updates. And, a huge thanks to all of the events organizers and communities who have engaged with us throughout the last few months. Regardless of whether we were able to work together or not, it is humbling to see the passion that so many people in the open geo / humanitarian space bring to their work.

**What is the HOT unSummit?**

In our ongoing mission to bring together communities, partners, collaborators, and supporters of humanitarian open mapping, we are trying a fresh approach to the HOT Summit. Instead of hosting a single event, this year we are [investing our time and resources](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/update-on-the-2022-and-2023-summits/) in supporting global, regional, and local conferences and community events around the world to bring the spirit of the Summit to thousands of new people.

We are calling this the "HOT unSummit," emphasizing the continuity of this new approach with HOT's flagship annual event without claiming a 'higher ground' compared to the events we partner and collaborate with.
