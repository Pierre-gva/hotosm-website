A big thanks to ALL members for helping recruit a cohort of new members who possess a broad experience within the OpenStreetMap community. The community is gaining new skills and  growing stronger each day through leadership, training, and mapping project participation. We look forward to working with HOTs Membership on issues related to the governance of the organization, electing the Board of Directors, and chair/co-chairing different working groups that touch all aspects of HOT’s work.
