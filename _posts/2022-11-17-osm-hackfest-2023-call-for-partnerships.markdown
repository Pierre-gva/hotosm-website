Over the past two years, Open Mapping Hub - Asia Pacific (OMH-AP) has been working in it’s vision to create a sustainable OpenStreetMap (OSM) ecosystem in the Asia pacific region. We have been supporting various community led activities and helping numerous  champions emerge within the OSM ecosystem. Our efforts have been primarily focused in supporting new communities, creating map data and ensuring the quality of the data.

As the OSM movement in the region grows, we realize the need to have people who can utilize the created open data in projects for social impact. In June 2022, We organized the first ever OSM Hackfest, reaching out to more than 600  students in Nepal. When we organized the Hackfest we had the following goals in our mind:

* Introduce Computer Science, IT and engineering students to the OpenStreetMap ecosystem generally and the OSM tech stack in particular.

* Make the students aware about learning and career opportunities present in engaging with the community and projects available within these ecosystems.

* Provide students with hands-on experience on utilizing OpenStreetMap data and developing products using the OSM data.

* Engage students in advancing the OSM movement and challenge them to build tools to create local impact, utilizing OpenStreetMap data and services.

We were very excited to organize the event and it was one for the books! After a rigorous selection process, participants underwent a closed camp for a week where they worked in groups to develop their projects further. All the teams gained a deeper understanding of OSM & Open Technologies and were able to develop their ideas into tangible project plans that can be implemented to create social impact.
