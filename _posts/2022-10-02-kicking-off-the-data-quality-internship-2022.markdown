**Daniel Osei Agyeman**

My name is Daniel Osei Agyeman, and I’ve been a young mapper since 2016. During the GIS celebration day in 2016, I joined YouthMappers while in level 200 at the University of Cape Coast. Since the day I learned how to map with JOSM, I’ve been an active mapper. I’ve worked remotely on a few projects, including 390 tasks on COVID-19 - Yelimane Cercle 4 - Kayes Region, Mali and 136 on Missing Maps: Zimbabwe Malaria Elimination 8. Professionally, I have mapped areas both internationally and in Ghana. I’ve mapped a number of locations in the Northern, Central, and Greater Accra regions.

While working on various field projects in Ghana, particularly in the north, I became acutely aware of the use of the data that we generate remotely, as well as the difficulties that arise when such data is of poor quality. I am inspired to participate in this internship in order to obtain more information and abilities to help me generate more quality data to help both on-field and off-field professionals in their area of work. Also, the fact that I can share the information I receive here with my local youth mappers chapter so that we can continue to develop quality data to be utilized to tackle challenges in our society.

**Anisa Dhakal**

I was made familiar with OSM platform in my first year of Bachelor Degree of Geomatics Engineering through ‘Youth Mapper University Chapter GESAN’. Then, I made my OSM profile on May 13th 2020.

I mapped some of my village area through ID editor. But when my friend introduced me to the HOT Tasking Manager platform and use of JOSM, I was really happy to know that my contributions of mapping were soon utilized for different humanitarian and development purposes through various active and urgent projects. While mapping in my initial year, I had trouble with the tools and plugin and even some technical problem with my updating of works. Then I consulted with my friends and searched for solutions. The more I had to tackle with problem, the more I became interested in it. Still, I am learning to be skilled in mapping and trying to learn some validation skills.

Till now I have contributed to various active projects through the HOT Tasking Manager. I have participated in ‘Field Mapping Tools Workshop’ organized by Open Pacific Hub, ‘Empowering Women In Geospatial Informationen Technology-2022 edition’ by SERVIR Hindu Kush, where I learned about Q-GIS and Remote Sensing. Recently, I had contributed to Remote Mapping Kakamega, Kenya for Transportation Needs Assessment.

I am Dhivya, from Sri Lanka. I have completed my BSc. (Hons) in Town & Country Planning at the University of Moratuwa. After my graduation, I worked as a GIS assistant in the World bank funded project under the ministry of irrigation. Because of the academic & work experience I had a passion and interest in the field of GIS & Data collection. Then I completed MSC in GIS & Remote Sensing at the University of Sri Jeyawardhanapura. While completing my MSC, I got to know about OSM. As the town planner & the GIS user I know the value of the data. OSM is an open data source where anyone can contribute and download the data. After my pregnancy I was at home for a long. In that time, I have contributed myself to the OSM and I have involved with OSM society. It has become very interesting. I created the great OSM profile, I am also an active in the OSM Sri Lankan community.

I strongly believe that OSM encourages women participation. Even though anyone can contribute to the OSM I always think about the data quality. So I wanted to learn and develop new skills in OSM. At the time, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) had a call for applications for the HOT Data Quality Internship. So I applied.

**Walter Mayeku**

I joined OpenStreetMap in 2017 as an active mapper, with growing interests after interacting with OMSers around the world and consistent involvement in projects both locally and internationally, I have grown my mapping experience to an advanced level. I have well elaborate buildings mapping advantage over other OSM features with a substantial validation experience. Preferably I enjoy mapping using JOSM over ID editor because of its capabilities and versatility when it becomes to applicabilities with plugins and advancements. 

I joined the Data Quality Internship program so that I can affirm my mapping and validation abilities across OSM and around the world; to be a quality data ambassador.

## About the Program

Data Quality Interns will be trained on how to validate projects using the HOT Tasking Manager. We aim to validate 90 projects in the three month long program. Training opportunities will include quality assurance and quality control and will include the usage of a range of open source tools. HOT’s [Data Principals](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/data-principles/) will be used to communicate the importance of data quality and its maintenance. 

To ensure continued engagement with HOT’s validation community and data quality activities, we are working to evolve a sustainability model at the end of the program - more to come on this in the coming months!
