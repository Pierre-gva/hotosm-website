Within the framework of International Women's Day 2023, the Open Mapping Hub of Latin America and the Caribbean jointly organized with the [OpenLabEc](https://openlab.ec/) the conversation called "[Women, Maps and Data](https://openlab.ec/actividad/conversatorio-mujeres-mapas-y-datos#no-back)", which was held on Thursday, March 9.

The event had the participation of a multidisciplinary panel of speakers who, from their different professional experiences, contributed enriching perspectives to the already broad theme of maps and data worked by women. The event was hosted by [Maria Encalada](https://www.derechosdigitales.org/equipo/maria-encalada/) from OpenLabEc.

Below is a brief summary of the interventions carried out:

Ana [presented](https://twitter.com/OpenlabEc/status/1633975580252045313) the project [¿What about us in the streets?](https://diverciudades.com/y-nosotras-en-las-calles/) focused on an analysis of the names of the streets of Quito. The project questions how cities have been built and reflects on the lack of presence of women in their historical memory.

An interesting fact resulting from the analysis carried out is that streets named after women represent only 4% of the total 5,500 km of streets in Quito city.

Then she briefly shared with us other projects focused on products such as [Latam bike paths](https://co.datasketch.store/products/camiseta-ciclorrutas-de-latam), based on maps of bikeways in several Latin American cities, and the one on the cultural agenda.

Co-founder and Director of [Japiqay](http://www.japiqay.org/). Bachelor of Social Communication from the Univ. Mayor de San Marcos. A mom since 10 years ago. With almost 20 years of experience in journalistic investigation on issues of corruption, human rights, contracting and public policies. "Convinced that we can defeat corruption and impunity if we do it together."

Gabriela [presented](https://twitter.com/OpenlabEc/status/1633982967746818052) the projects she has worked on in Japiqay - which means "to keep in memory" in Quechua -, mainly [Memory and Citizenship](http://memoriayciudadania.org/), a platform that brings together more than 2,000 files related to corruption cases in Peru over the last forty years.

She also talked about the project [From the number to the face](https://delacifralrostro.org/), which shows the real impact that corruption has on the rights and lives of Peruvians; Likewise, it identifies the political, economic and/or social actors that operate in favor of impunity in cases of corruption.

The event concluded with a round of questions that focused on the importance and possibilities of maps in all these perspectives of the female experience in the use of various technologies and data.

And although at first impression it seems that topics such as design, public administration or the fight against corruption are a bit alien to maps, the speakers in this conversation clearly demonstrated that they are fields with many possibilities for open maps and the various tools that facilitate its use to be applied.

Finally, here you have the video of the conversation so that you can appreciate for yourself the interventions of each of the participants.
