HOT's vision  and values are tools we use to guide our work. They were developed by  consulting with nearly every HOT staff member throughout a three-month long process. Sixty-five voting members and staff from 50 countries contributed ideas, opinions and perspectives. Four workshops brought voting members and staff together to discuss ways we can all live and exemplify the values in our daily lives.

Our Vision Statement is our aspiration for the world we want to create together.

Our Core Values represent our shared core beliefs that we care most deeply about.
